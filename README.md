# pysqkit

Pysqkit is an open-source Python package for studying superconducting qubits with a particular focus on the simulation of the dynamics of these systems.

Currently the focus is on transmon and fluxonium systems. For these qubits, Pysqkit allows the extract of the energy levels, wavefunctions and matrix elements.

Qubits can currently be coupled to each other, currently via capacitive couplers. A drive can be applied on each qubit of this system.
